## 🗓️ Hijri Date Offset

Since the Hijri calendar can vary by region depending on local moon sighting (ru'yah), you can manually adjust the displayed date to match your local Islamic authority:

- Open the app settings
- Tap **Hijri Date Adjustment**
- Use **+** or **−** to shift the date (range: −2 to +2 days)
- The adjustment applies to all date displays **and** Islamic event detection

> _Example: If your country observes Eid one day later than the calculated date, set the offset to +1. All events and fasting reminders will shift accordingly._
